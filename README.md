# Advent of Code 2020

## Day 1

I got a late start on this and Ruby is my go-to language for get'er done.

I'm thinking I could have used a single functions w/ some recursion but this completed the challenge and it isnt overly complex. To do this recursively I'd have to take into account the number of iterations and the challenge only went to 3, so meh.

## Day 2

Still catching up, still Ruby. Made a class for this one, I like it...

## Day 3

Recursion! This one was my favorite so far and stumped me for a bit. In my recursion I accidently did an extra assignment that threw off just a couple of the results. But I am very happy with the length of this solution.

## Day 4

So, I'll probably just stick with keeping this whole challenge in Ruby. This day's challenge got another Class thrown at it. I had fun setting up the validation logic on it. Overkill for the challenge? Maybe, but it seems to be able to scale and be extensible.
